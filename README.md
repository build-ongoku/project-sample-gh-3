# sample-gh-3

This project was generated using [Ongoku](https://ongoku.com), a low-code backend development framework that automates boilerplate code generation.

## About Ongoku

Ongoku is designed to help developers build backend systems faster by defining their data models in a simple YAML schema file. Ongoku then generates all the necessary code, including database models, REST APIs, and business logic stubs, so you can focus on your core application logic.

## Features

- Auto-generated database models and migrations  
- REST API support  
- Extensible service layer for custom business logic  
- Built-in authentication and authorization (if configured)  
- Works seamlessly with PostgreSQL  

## Getting Started on Local Machine

 This only works on Mac OS, for now, using Docker Desktop. 

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Ongoku
  - License key should be placed in `~/.ongoku/license.txt`
  - You should have access to the Ongoku docker image at `ghcr.io/build-ongoku/goku:latest`

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:  

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/build-ongoku/project-sample-gh-3.git
   cd project-sample-gh-3
   ```

2. Set up the project:

   a. Create `.env.goku.dev` file using the `env.goku.template` file as a base.

   b. If you are on Mac (and using Docker Desktop), go to your `Docker Dashboard > Settings > Resources > Network` and turn on "Network Host" (if it's not already turned on).

3. Run Ongoku:

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it --pull=always \
    -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" \
    -v "$HOME/.ongoku/license.txt:/root/.ongoku/license.txt:ro" \
    -v ".:/go-goku/project" \
    -w /go-goku/project \
    -e GOKU_RUNNING_IN_DOCKER=1 -e GOKU_DEV_DATABASE_USE_DOCKER=1 -e GOKU_DOCKER_HOST_PROJECT_PATH=$(PWD) \
    --net=host \
    ghcr.io/build-ongoku/goku:latest \
    goku dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URLs provided to you by the command output from the previous step.
